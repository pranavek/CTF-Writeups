The robots.txt file must be located at the root of a website. The robots exclusion instructs how the crawlers should crawl the specific website.

Open the website from the description. Append robots.txt to the URL and open it. There is a Disallow entry for `/8028f.html`. Append this URL to the webiste, the flag is present in it.
